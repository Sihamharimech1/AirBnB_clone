# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

This project is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. The goal is to create a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This interpreter will help in initializing, serializing, and deserializing instances of various classes. It will also allow us to create, update, retrieve, and destroy objects such as User, State, City, Place, and others.
